# About

Kiwi is a tool that keeps track of the D202 key.

## Why

Currently there are two methods of keeping track of where the D202 key is. Firstly, there is a pen-and-paper system where people write down their name and the date when they collect the key at reception. The second system is a Discord bot in a private discord server where people can use slash commands to log when they took the key.

The problem with the first system is that it only keeps track of who took the key from the reception desk in the morning, but when the key gets transferred to someone else, the paper records do not get updated.

The problem with the second system is that it is a closed server and thus cannot be used by teachers or students who are not in the server.

A standalone tool that keeps track of the key is thus useful
